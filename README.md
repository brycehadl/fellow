# Password Generator Starter Code
## Information Added
<ul>I was trying to write my javascript in a simple format though I began running out of time so my grouping isnt nearly as good as I was able to find in many documentation examples though my code is fully operational.</ul>
<ul>This project fixes the generate code function by running an code structure that changes the numbers symbols in a random password generator.</ul>
<ul>In this project I learned how to format and structure javascipt and write code that successfully alerts features and doesn't overmanage the code given in my css and html.</ul>
